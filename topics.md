# Test Topics
This is the test page for the topics page.

### Hopefully...
Hopefully Aaron can see this and approves of
this approach to managing our markdown content.

[Here](https://github.com/cgburgess/comp426-md) is a link to the github. I have added
as a collaborator. 

It is also possible to edit the content right in the browser with the 
github markdown editor. Click the pencil icon.

1. I like it
2. it is cool.
3. and easier to write in than html
    1. No denying this point.
    2. Way more readable.
    3. Way more write-able. 
4. We never have to touch the server files.

### TODO
I am going to convert the topics html to markdown and then start working
on the assignments.
