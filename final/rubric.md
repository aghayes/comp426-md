# 426 Final Project Rubric

## Final

### 15% Presentation / Expo

TODO
This portion of your grade will come from you attending the expo at the end of the semester. This will be held during the final exam time. More details will be given about this towards the end of the semester. 

### 15% Video
A short video no longer than 5 minutes showing off the functionality of the website. Think of this video as a pitch to convince us (some company or whomever your target audience is) that we should choose your website/product.

TODO
Explain your audience, the problem the audience has, how the app solves the problem.

- Pitch with functionality demo
- Audience customer base
- Problem and solution
- Maximum of 5 minutes. No minimum (but if you don't show off the website to impress us the other components of your grade will suffer.
- An extended elevator pitch. A "commercial" that is showing off why you should use this site.

### 40% minimum core requirements
These requirements must be met to guarantee at least a grade of 40%. How well you implement the following is part of your design.

1. Autocomplete - Some kind of non-contrived input where when typing a user would expect suggestions to appear. This should implement some debouncing.
2. User accounts with login (username/email and password) and signup. 
3. Create read update delete resources from your data store.
4. Depend on a dynamic data source (your backend) and not solely on static content.
5. Use public/private/and user-specific data sections from the data store.
6. Employ a 3rd party API

    
### 30% Design 
Does the website look and behave well? This is not only the aesthetic appearance of the site. It takes into account the structure of the pages and usability. Does the website behave like a user would expect from a modern web app online? 
- UX
- UI

## Proposal

TODO
A typed, half a page, single spaced write up describing the application and which elements of it do you plan on satisfying the parts of the rubric. You should have a mock up of what the website structure will be.
