# Cloning the Course Repository
Some of the assignments in COMP 426 come with starter code to help you get going. You will upload completed assignments for grading using a special command-line submission tool. This guide shows how to download both the assignment starter code and the command line interface (CLI) submission code.

Make sure you install the required software before attempting this guide.


## Guide
1. Open Visual Studio Code (Later referred to as VSCode or VSC)
2. Select "View" from the top bar and click on "Command Pallete..." in the box that pops up, type "Git: Clone" (should begin to autofill) and press enter.
3. Copy and paste the following URL into the bar that pops up: 

[https://github.com/onsmith/comp426-cli.git]

4. Press Enter Twice. Select "Open Repository" once the option arises.
5. Open the "View" menu and select "Integrated Terminal" (or just "Terminal" on Mac). Type the following command then press enter and wait for the install to complete:

```
npm install
```

This command installs some dependencies on your computer. We'll learn all about how this works and what npm is later in the semester!

During this step, you may see some warnings appear. This is expected, and you can safely ignore them.
