# Assignment 2

Directly writing raw, static HTML and CSS is feasible for smaller sites like the mythical one you designed for a01. However, it's easy to see that writing raw HTML and CSS quickly becomes messy---especially for large, complex, dynamic sites containing many pages. While every website you have ever used is ultimately expressed in terms of CSS and HTML, modern web developers typically have many tools at their disposal to help organize the code, reduce redundancy, and promote best practices.

In particular, [frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) are widely employed for assisting with web development. A framework is a tool that enforces an organizational scheme on the code that you write, with the goal of helping you to produce better software. Here are a few of the benefits of using a framework to organize your application:

* They speed up the development process
* They make your code easier to read
* They reduce the potential for bugs
* They prevent code duplication
* They provide pre-written solutions to common tasks that you are likely to encounter

A framework is typically written in a particular language and is designed to help you write a particular type of software. For example, Angular, React, and Vue are examples of JavaScript frameworks designed to help you write organized JavaScript code for the browser. We'll learn more about these frameworks towards the end of the semester.

In this assignment we will be exploring Bulma, a CSS framework designed to help you organize the way you add style to HTML pages. By linking Bulma to your HTML pages and adding a few special classes to your HTML elements, you can drastically improve the look and feel of a page while reducing the amount of custom CSS you have to write.

> While Bulma is a great CSS framework, it's not the only one out there. [This blog post](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/6-popular-css-frameworks-to-use-in-2019) lists five other CSS frameworks that are also popular right now. When planning a new web app, picking a CSS framework can be difficult, and there are a lot of factors to consider. Ultimately, try to pick one that will allow you to rapidly produce quality designs.

CSS frameworks are a quick and easy way to make pretty websites, but they're no substitute for understanding the underlying CSS rules that are being applied. For this course, it's important to have a working understanding of the fundamentals before relying on tools like Bulma.


## 1. Getting started

1. To get started, open Visual Studio Code and take a look at the a02 assignment directory.
2. A few HTML files have already been provided for you. Open these files and get a feel for the contents. You'll also notice that there are no CSS files included.
3. Next, open a terminal **in the a02 assignment directory** and initialize a new npm project for a02 using the `npm init` command (see the a00 instructions if you need help with this).
4. While you have the terminal open, also add Browsersync as a dependency to your new project (using the command `npm install browser-sync`).
5. Start Browsersync from your terminal (`browser-sync start -sw`) and see how the HTML files look when rendered in the browser.


## 2. Installing Bulma

Our job for this assignment is to add Bulma styles to the HTML files provided in the assignment directory. Without writing a single line of CSS, we will use Bulma to improve the way the page looks.

### 2.1. Downloading Bulma

As a CSS framework, Bulma is essentially a single, giant CSS file. Our goal, then, is to add the Bulma CSS file to the HTML pages in the a02 folder. Recall that CSS stylesheets may be linked to HTML documents by adding a special `<link />` tag inside the `<head>` of the document.

Where do we get the Bulma CSS file? There are three options:
1. Download the Bulma CSS file manually, add it to the a02 folder, and `<link>` with a relative path.
2. `<link` directly to an online version of the Bulma CSS file hosted by a Content Distribution Network (CDN).
3. Download the Bulma CSS file as a *dependency* using npm, and `<link>` to it relatively in `node_modules`.

These three options are discussed in more detail on [the official getting started with Bulma page](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/). Using npm to install the package as a dependency is the recommended option, so that's what we will do for this assignment. In general, installing packages through npm is the best route when you need to add third party code to your web apps.

Therefore, to download Bulma, run the following command from the terminal in your a02 folder:
```bash
$ npm install bulma
```

> Note: You may still have Browsersync running in your terminal from Section 1. Thus, to run `npm install bulma`, you either need to open a *new* terminal from the a02 folder (right click the a02 folder and select "Open in Terminal"), or you need to kill the Browsersync process with `Ctrl + C`.


### 2.2. Linking to Bulma in HTML

Now that Bulma has been downloaded, the next step is to add a `<link>` tag to the `<head>` of the HTML files. But what URL should we use as the `href` attribute of the `<link>` tag? We need to look at the files that were downloaded by npm and search for the correct CSS file.

Every time you install a new dependency, npm automatically downloads the requested files from the internet and puts them in a special folder named `node_modules`. This process occurred when you ran `npm install bulma`, meaning the Bulma files are now ready and waiting in the `node_modules` folder in your a02 directory. Open `node_modules` now and confirm that `bulma` has been downloaded. It should look something like this:

![Bulma is in the node_modules folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgburgess/comp426-md/master/assignments/resources/a02/bulma-code.png "Bulma is in the node_modules folder")

Inside of the new `node_modules/bulma` folder is a list of files that collectively make up Bulma. In particular, you'll notice a sub-folder named `css`, which contains three files:

* `node_modules/css/bulma.css`
* `node_modules/css/bulma.css.map`
* `node_modules/css/bulma.min.css`

Those two `.css` files are exactly what we're looking for! In fact, both `bulma.css` and `bulma.min.css` represent complete copies of the Bulma CSS source code, and either one would work for this assignment.

What is the difference between the two files? `bulma.min.css` is a *minified* version of Bulma, which means the CSS code was purposefully compressed to take up as little space as possible. All newlines and whitespace are gone, 


## Updating dependencies

The dependencies that you add to your application may change over time. Each dependent package is owned and maintained by a different developer or team of developers, and many of these packages are actively being improved. This means that occasionally the maintainer of a package may release a new version of the code with bug fixes, new features, or code improvements. Every once and a while, you may want to make sure that your app is using the newest version of the dependencies. Luckily, npm makes this easy. Simply run the following command from a terminal pointed at your app's root folder.
```bash
$ npm update
```
The process may take a few seconds or minutes to complete, but when its done all of your dependencies should be up to date!


## Removing a dependency

If you ever encounter a situation where you have installed a dependency that you later realize you do not need, you can use the `npm uninstall` command to remove the package both from the `node_modules` folder and from the `package.json` file.
```bash
$ npm uninstall package-name-here
```
