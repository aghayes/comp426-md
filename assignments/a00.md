## 1. Install Required Software  
  
Below are two links that guide you through the process of installing the recommended software for this course. It is important to have this not only so you can complete the assignments, but also so you can receive help in office hours. We recommend using visual studio code but if you are willing to sign up for a student license we also recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).
