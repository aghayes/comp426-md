 Welcome to Comp426 - *Modern Web Programming*. The purpose of this is assignment is to get you familiar with the tools that will be used for the rest of the semester.     
    
The course assignments will consist of 11 (including this assignment) assignments that are to be completed by their due dates.     
- There will be late penalties.    
- Working with other students is not allowed. Be careful to not submit anything that has copied code from others or the internet as you may get flagged by the system for cheating.     
    
*Note that this assignment is only graded for completion. The last section will cover how to submit and check that you have received a 100% score.*    
 ## 1. Install Required Software    
 Below are two links that guide you through the process of installing the recommended software for this course. It is important to have this not only so you can complete the assignments, but also so you can receive help in office hours. We recommend using visual studio code but if you are willing to sign up for a student license we also recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

## 2. Setup Workspace
  
So at this point you have installed the required software and are ready to setup your workspace. This will be the root directory that all of your assignments will be written in. Once you are done with the setup process it will even handle all of the code submission for you with a few simple commands.

### Clone the GitHub repo

First things first we need to clone the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/onsmith/comp426-cli) that has been made for this class. If you use the the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) you can clone the repo through that. We are going to be cloning this through the command line.
