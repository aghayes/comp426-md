# Assignment 0

Welcome to Comp426 - *Modern Web Programming*. The purpose of this is assignment is to get you familiar with the tools that will be used for the rest of the semester.       
      
The course will consist of 11 (including this assignment) assignments that are to be completed by their due dates.       
- There will be late penalties.      
- Working with other students is not allowed. Be careful to not submit anything that has copied code from others or the internet as you may get flagged by the system for cheating.       
      
*Note that this assignment is only graded for completion. The last section will cover how to submit and check that you have received a 100% score.*   
   
 ## 1. Install Required Software      
 
 Below are two links that guide you through the process of installing the recommended software for this course. It is important to have this not only so you can complete the assignments, but also so you can receive help in office hours. We recommend using visual studio code but if you are willing to sign up for a student license we also recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

## 2. Setup Workspace
  So at this point we have installed the required software and are ready to setup our workspace. This will be the root directory that all of our assignments will be written in. Once we are done with the setup process it will even handle submitting our code for grading with a few simple commands.  
  
### 2.1 Clone the GitHub repo  
  
First things first, we need to clone the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/onsmith/comp426-cli) that has been made for this class. If you use the the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) you can clone the repo through that. We are going to be cloning this through the command line.   
  
*If you are unfamiliar with the command line don't worry. We are going to be walking you through every command used to be successful in this class. If you want further explanations on some of the commands we use or want to learn more check out the [linux commands cheat sheet](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/).*  
  
Open <abbr title="Powershell on windows">terminal</abbr> and `cd` to a place on your computer where you want to store your assignments.
```bash  
$ cd CodeProjects  
```  
Once there, clone the repository and open the directory with the following commands.  
```bash  
$ git clone https://github.com/onsmith/comp426-cli.git  
$ cd comp426-cli/  
$ ls  
```  
When we run the `ls` command now, it should list out directories where we will be placing all of our code for future assignments.   
  
### 2.2 Time to Initialize  
  
So at this point our terminal is inside the directory `../comp426-cli/`. Before we do anything else we need to make sure it is ready for us to work in and more importantly, handle submissions. We are going to do this by running the following command:  
```bash  
$ npm install  
```  
*This may take some time complete depending on your internet speed so give it time to finish.*  
  
This tells <abbr title="Node Package Manager">npm</abbr> to check our `package.json` file and install all the dependencies listed there. You will learn more about npm in a future assignment.  
  
## 3. Demo 

Now that we have everything setup lets go ahead and run through a quick demo to make sure everything works and we are able to submit. **All you need to do is follow along and copy and paste to receive full credit.**

### 3.1 Initialize a00

1. We are going to start by opening up VSCode. Then `File -> Open...` and choose the `comp426-cli` folder that was cloned in part 2.
2. If the explorer isn't already open, go ahead open that. It is the [top left icon on the left side bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgburgess/comp426-md/master/assignments/resources/a00/open-explorer.png).
3. `Right click on a00 -> Open in Terminal`. The prompt should now look something like this:
```bash
your-computer-name:a00 yourname$ 
```
The import thing here is **a00**. This means that all the commands you run and packages you install will only apply to the contents of the a00 folder. 

*Now and in the future, make sure you are always running commands inside the assignment folder and NOT in the root folder (submitting assignments is different).*

5. Now run `npm init` and press enter through all the prompts.

At this point a00 should now have a `package.json` with the following code:

```json
{
  "name": "a00",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```
### 3.2 Install live-server
Inside our terminal we are going to run a command that is going to install a 3rd party package.
```bash
$ npm i live-server
```
- npm: The package manager from node
- i: install
- live-server: The name of the thing to install

Now that [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) is installed to a00 by npm, we are ready to start copy-pasting!

### 3.3 HTML
We are going to need some html. `Right click on a00 -> New File` and name it `index.html`.

Paste in the following and save it:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html lang="en">  
<head>  
 <meta charset="UTF-8">  
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  
 <title>Assignment 0 test!</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
<div>  
 <h1>Looking good!</h1>  
 <p>Go ahead and edit me.</p>  
</div>  
</body>  
</html>
```

### 3.3 Run live-server
Now that we have our simple HTML file its time to see if things actually work. With your terminal still inside the a00 folder, go ahead and run the following command.
```bash
$ npx live-server
```
*npx is not a typo, it is a command used to run locally installed tools like live-server.*

A browser window should have opened. If not, start chrome and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). You should see the text inside the `<h1> </h1>` and `<p> </p>` now being rendered on the website.

### 3.4 Edit Some HTML
At this point, we are going to go ahead change some of our HTML. When we save we should see the webpage automatically reload and reflect that changes. This makes development easier and faster. Get used to this workflow because it is an industry standard and it should make A1 much easier!

Change line 14 from:
```html
<p>Go ahead and edit me.</p>
```
to:
```html
<strong>Almost done I promise.</strong>
```
Press save and watch the webpage reload and reflect our new changes.

## 4. Submit
