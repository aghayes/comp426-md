 Welcome to Comp426 - *Modern Web Programming*. The purpose of this is assignment is to get you familiar with the tools that will be used for the rest of the semester.       
      
The course will consist of 11 (including this assignment) assignments that are to be completed by their due dates.       
- There will be late penalties.      
- Working with other students is not allowed. Be careful to not submit anything that has copied code from others or the internet as you may get flagged by the system for cheating.       
      
*Note that this assignment is only graded for completion. The last section will cover how to submit and check that you have received a 100% score.*   
   
 ## 1. Install Required Software      
 
 Below are two links that guide you through the process of installing the recommended software for this course. It is important to have this not only so you can complete the assignments, but also so you can receive help in office hours. We recommend using visual studio code but if you are willing to sign up for a student license we also recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/).

## 2. Setup Workspace
  So at this point we have installed the required software and are ready to setup our workspace. This will be the root directory that all of our assignments will be written in. Once we are done with the setup process it will even handle submitting our code for grading with a few simple commands.  
  
### 2.1 Clone the GitHub repo  
  
First things first, we need to clone the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/onsmith/comp426-cli) that has been made for this class. If you use the the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com/) you can clone the repo through that. We are going to be cloning this through the command line.   
  
*If you are unfamiliar with the command line don't worry. We are going to be walking you through every command used to be successful in this class. If you want further explanations on some of the commands we use or want to learn more check out the [linux commands cheat sheet](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/).*  
  
Open <abbr title="Powershell on windows">terminal</abbr> and `cd` to a place on your computer where you want to store your assignments.
```bash  
$ cd CodeProjects  
```  
Once there we can go ahead and clone the repository and open the directory with the following command.  
```bash  
$ git clone https://github.com/onsmith/comp426-cli.git  
$ cd comp426-cli/  
$ ls  
```  
When we run the `ls` command now it should list out directories where we will be placing all of our code for future assignments.   
  
### 2.2 Time to Initialize  
  
So at this point our terminal is inside the directory `../comp426-cli/`. Before we do anything else we need to make sure its ready for us to work in and more importantly, handle submissions. We are going to do this by running the following command:  
```bash  
$ npm install  
```  
*This may take some time complete depending on your internet speed so give it time to finish.*  
  
This tells <abbr title="Node Package Manager">npm</abbr> to check our `package.json` file and install all the dependencies listed there. You will learn more about npm in a future assignment.  
  
## 3. Demo 

Now that we have everything setup lets go ahead and run through a quick demo to make sure everything works and we are able to submit. **All you need to do is follow along and copy and paste to receive full credit.**

### 3.1 Initialize a00

1. We are going to start my opening up VisualStudioCode. Then `File -> Open...` and choose the `comp426-cli` that was cloned in part 2.
2. If the explorer isn't already open, go ahead open that. It is the [top left icon on the left side bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgburgess/comp426-md/master/assignments/resources/a00/open-explorer.png).
3. `Right click on a00 -> Open in Terminal`.
4. Now run `npm init` and press enter through all the prompts.

At this point a00 should now have a `package.json` with the following code:

```json
{
  "name": "a00",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```


## 4. Submit
