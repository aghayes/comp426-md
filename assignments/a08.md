# Assignment 8

This assignment is a tutorial in which we will write JavaScript code to make the browser send HTTP AJAX requests and receive the server's response. We'll use a third-party library called [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to help us formulate the HTTP requests, send them, wait for them to finish, and process the response. Finally, we'll run the code we write directly in the Google Chrome browser and view the requests we make through Chrome's DevTools window.


## 1. Getting Started

1. Open Visual Studio Code and take a look at the a08 assignment directory.

2. You should see one HTML file (`a08/index.html`), one linked CSS file (`a08/style.css`), and one linked JavaScript file (`a08/script.js`). Open these files and skim their contents. 

3. Open a terminal in the a08 assignment directory and initialize a new npm project using `npm init`.

4. Use `npm install` to install the package `axios`. Refer to a02 or [the official Axios documentation](https://github.com/axios/axios#installing) if you need to review installing packages with npm.

5. Link the downloaded Axios library to the index.html file. To do this, find the Axios `TODO` comment in `a08/index.html` and add a `<script>` tag with `src` attribute pointing to the correct Axios `.js` file, located somewhere in the `a08/node_modules/axios` folder.

> **Hint**: If you're having trouble finding the correct file to link, refer to a02 and/or a04 to reread the process that we used to link to Bulma and jQuery. The Axios code is organized very similarly to jQuery; there is a special `dist` folder containing the relevant "distribution" Axios code.

6. Run `browser-sync -sw` to start the Browsersync local development server. This should automatically open a new browser tab showing the contents of `a08/index.html`.

> Note: If you get a `command not found` error, it likely means you have not installed Browsersync as a global npm package. Go back to Section 5.4 in Assignment a02 to see what it means to install packages globally, and follow the instructions to install Browsersync as a global npm package.
