# Assignment 3

While writing HTML and CSS is necessary for making any website, the core that drives these technologies forward is JavaScript. It is the backbone of every modern web framework and is required if you want to make interactive web pages. This assignment wont be using a web browser at all. When we want to execute JavaScript outside of the browser environment we use [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/). This makes writing JavaScript like writing any other programming language. 

In order to run your .js files:

> **Visual Studio Code**:
 We reccomend installing [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) from the visual studio extensions panel. Once that is installed you can simply right click and press run. There will also be a play button in the top right that can be pressed. 

> **Webstorm**:
Right click on the file and choose run. From then on you can simply press the green play button in the top right. 

All of the starting files where you will place your code have been provided for you inside the a03 folder. If you wish to separate your code into seperate files or makes helper functions feel free to do so. 

*TODO: Add the files that will be specified. Include info about how to export these properly for the autograder. Talk about defing things and how to run. Webstorm runs them through a right click menu. Need to see about vscode.*
